Drivers are required to follow those schedules as close as they can, but sometimes buses can run late or early. So, I recommend giving yourself **4 minutes** of extra time at the stops. I\'ll also warn you if you should be at the stop.\n\nSince I don\‚Äôt get any data from the buses themselves, I cannot guarantee the stop times accuracy, but hopefully they\‚Äôll give you a general idea of when the bus will arrive. \n\nGo ahead and type `!bus` for the next stop times or `!help` for help on other commands. I\‚Äôm not just a bus schedule!\n\nLooking forward to helping you out!\n\nPS: I\'m still a work in progress so do tell Kevin of any issues! üëç',
